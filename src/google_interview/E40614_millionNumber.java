 weird question

 Suppose you have a million integer numbers.
 Return all possible values of a,b and c such that
 a+b+c<=d.
 d will be provided to you.
 ex: if the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
 and d=7
 [1,2,3]
 [1,2,4]

 [1,2,3] will be same as [1,3,2] and [3,2,1]...

 follow up:

 Return all such parts that satisfy the above condition if d is not provided.
