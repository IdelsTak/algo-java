You have an array of integers(size N), such that each integer is present an odd number of time, except 3 of them(which are present even number of times). Find the three numbers.

Only XOR based solution was permitted.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input:
{1,6,4,1,4,5,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,7,9,5,9}
Sample Output:
1 6 8
